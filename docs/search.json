    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote sensing provides an approach to collect, store and extract environmental information from satellite image without direct contact(Robinson 1978). With the variety of available platforms, understanding the characteristics and difference between sensors presents an importance when studying ground features for a specific study area. When considering the suitability of satellite imagery, the user should concern about the basic characteristics:\n\nType of sensor\nPassive sensor measures radiance emitted or reflected by earth-atmospheric system, while active sensor emits EMR waves and measure ‘back-scattered’ radiation. Mentioned by Horning (2008), although passive sensor doesn’t requires energy source and rely on solar radiation, it presents multiple limitation regarding the requirement of daylight, adverse impact by weather and cloud cover, and lack of ability to obtain information for the bottom of feature. Oppositely, other than the ability to operate in day or night and penetrate cloud cover, radar system is also widely adopted for acquiring digital elevation data as signals from most systems can penetrate through canopy or even dry ground (Horning 2008).\nResolution\nThe resolution of imagery can be analysed in spatial, spectral, temporal and radiometric aspects, which is determined by the specification of platform and sensors. Liang and Wang (2020) provided a detailed summary for characteristics of commonly used satellite sensor:\n\n\n\n\nResolution of commonly used satellite sensor (Liang and Wang 2020)\n\n\n\nData format\nMajority of remote sensing imagery is raster data, but data from radar system can also provide vertical information as lidar can make direct measurement of structure.\n\nThis week’s practical explores on the data acquisition, pre-processing and basic analysis of satellite imagery in QGIS, SNAP and R. In the pre-processing of imagery for spectral signature analysis, one question that I found interesting to investigate is the upscale or downscale of bands in resampling of data. To perform masking for study area, bands with various spatial resolution requires resampling to have a consistent resolution. Considering the level of details presented in high spatial resolution, I wonder what are the factors that we should consider during the decision of upscale or downscale of image. This question was investigated by Kitron et al. (2006) in their research of public health, which it is pointed out that there is always a temptation to extrapolate from fine-resolution data or interpolate from coarse resolution. The article discussed that coarse resolution may lost the spatial heterogeneity on the micro-scale, while a fine resolution will fails to detect the general patterns on the macro-scale. Authors approached this question by adjusting the scale of their study of diseases and analyse the achievable observations. The conclusion is both resolutions can successfully describe dispersion pattern or process of dispersal from different geographical level data, but the similarity behind is having a solid understanding of the system in time and space according to the purpose of study."

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nHaving comprehensive data source with various resolutions, remote sensing is widely applied in geospatial and environmental studies. According to Liang and Wang (2020), application of remote sensing can be categorized into 4 main categories:\n\n\n\nApplication of remote sensing product (Liang and Wang 2020)\n\n\nDefinition of each category is summarised below with related study as example.\n\nDetection and Monitoring\nUsing remote sensing data to characterise the surface dynamics and interactions from natural environment and human activities\nResearch Example:\nRemote sensing is often applied to drought monitoring and forecasting as it allows observations in large temporal and spatial scales. Vanajith et al. (2021) utilised Sentinel-2 data to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index and Vegetation Condition Index for monitoring drought condition over Solapur city, India. Authors used multispectral satellite images due to the provision of a wide range of bands with high resolution and low radiometric calibration uncertainty. The result successfully identified the constant drought conditions and demonstrated the suitability of these indices for drought monitoring.\nDriving numerical models and decision support systems\nUsing remote sensing data as input data for environmental related models and decision support systems\nResearch Example:\nRandin et al. (2020) used remote sensing to monitor biodiversity in the Anthropocene for species distribution models, because remote sensing is able to provide reliable data that is spatially comprehensive and time-sensitive about the key factors driving the distribution in biodiversity. A monitoring approach that the authors suggested was taking advantage of temporal stacking of available time series to capture the niche of species and actual distribution, while increasing the transferability of ecological model (Randin et al. 2020).\nValidating model simulations\nUsing remote sensing data to retrieve parameters for validation of numerical models\nResearch Example:\nCrop coefficient can be predicted from fraction of ground cover and vegetation height by using ground data and remote sensing, where remote sensing vegetation indices can also be used to validate the computation of parameters for maize, barley and olives (Pereira et al. 2020).\nData assimilation into numerical models\nData assimilation allows estimation of unknowns in model based of available information within a time window. Remote sensing data can be incorporated with measurement data and used in parameter adjustment.\nResearch Example:\nNair et al. (2022) introduced how remote sensing data in data assimilation to improve initial estimates for hydrollogical and atmospheric modelling, such as providing soil moisture data at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolutions across different scale for streamflow simulation, which can be complemented with in-situ surface and root zone observations for the calibration of model parameters.\n\nThese 4 categories effectively provide an insight on the diverse application of remote sensing data, from solely apply for detection, operation of numerical models and validation of models, to using incorporately for estimation of model parameters. The research examples showed that with utilisation of band features can provide estimation through band composition and indices, thus increase the possibility of applying remote sensing imagery with different numerical models. Study by Randin et al. (2020) also demonstrated that user can take advantage of the temporal resolution of remote sensing to obtain long-term series data for testing the temporal transferability of model."

    "text": "1.3 Reflection\nContent in week 1 provides an overview on how data from different platforms can be processed and manipulated to study the spectral significance of ground features. The part that I found interesting is the application of tasseled cap transformation in the study of image statistics. The transformation integrates original image data to new coordinate system by formulating brightness, greenness, wetness according to the spectral signature in bands. Band math increase the range of application of remote sensing data, which is also reflected in the research examples for calculation of indices and coefficients. From previous section, I also had a better understanding on how utilisation of data characteristics can lead to a wider application in different study areas, such as applying time series data to increase transferability in monitoring of changes. The advancement of remote sensing platforms will provide data with better resolution, and further enhance the flexibility of study in different scale and model application.\n\n\n\n\nHorning, N. 2008. “Remote Sensing.” In Encyclopedia of Ecology, edited by Sven Erik Jørgensen and Brian D.

    "section": "3.1 Summary",
    "text": "3.1 Summary\nIn order to correct possible errors in data acquisition and enhance image features, the geometric and radiometric properties of remote sensing images are handled by data processing system. Summarised by Liang and Wang (2020), the pre-processing tasks are essential before extracting environmental information from data, including radiometric processing and geometric processing.\n\nRadiometric Processing\nIn radiometric processing, corrections on data can be applied by radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction and orthorectification correction, while visualisation in image can be optimised by image enhancement and image fusion. Referencing to content in this week and Liang and Wang (2020), approaches in radiometric processing are described below:\n\n\n\nFlow chart of radiometric processing Source: week 3 content and\n\n\nWithin image enhancement, various approaches in each category can be performed to enhance spectral features of image. User can adjust how the satellite imagery is presented according to the study design and visual observation. For point operations, contrast enhancement is widely applied to optimise the image contrast and brightness or highlight information in specific DN ranges. To select the appropriate interactive contrast enhancement function, image quality can be assessed by visual observation and image data distribution in histogram through observing the effect of modification (“Point Operations (Contrast Enhancement)” 2016).\nAnother enhancement approach is applying filtering with neighbourhood processing. According to “Filtering and Neighbourhood Processing” (2016), possible operations are:\n\nLow pass filters (smoothing): reduce noise in image by removing high frequency information which also degrades image detail. Authors also suggested using edge-preserving filters to minimise the degradation of resolution if needed.\nHigh pass filters (edge enhancement): remove low frequency information and enhance features with high frequency , where filtering can be combined with contrast enhancement in point operation to adjust the contrast locally in a neighbourhood.\n\nFor correlated multi-variable datasets, principal component analysis is an effective technique, as it can concentrate the maximum information in multi-spectral data into a few uncorrelated principal components. PCA is able to reduce the redundancy in information between bands in multi-spectral data, which redundancy is caused by common image features in topography (“Principal Component Analysis” 2016). Thus, the operation is able to reduce the size of dataset and enable effective image RGB display when using multi-spctral remote sensing image.\nGeometric Processing\nImage acquired by sensor contains discrepancy with the true spatial properties of landscape, which the distortion can be caused by factors like changes in altitude, attitude and velocity, Earth rotation and curvature, surface relief displacement and perspective projections during image collection (Liang and Wang 2020). The figure below shows how geometric processing can be applied to original imagery for reducing the distortion by using ground control points and estimating RMSE.\n\n\n\nFlow chart of geometric processing\n\n\n“Image Geometric Operations” (2016) pointed out that GCP selections is of vital importance for the accuracy and automation of image warping\nco-registration, in which manual and semi-automatic GCP can be greatly affected by human error, causing automatic image co-registration to be more widely applied."

    "text": "3.2 Applications\n\n3.2.1 Radiometric Processing\nOther than the mentioned general operations, image enhancement can also apply specifically for certain weather condition. Kaplan (2018) proposed a hazy image model that determines the global airlight and transmission map by using mean and standard deviation of the original image. The proposed model is based on the existing hazy image model, which global airlight and transmission map are variables to be determined for the contrast restoration of weather degraded images. The author compared with former methods, like hybrid dark channel prior, and found out that the proposed enhancement method provides a better enhancement and edge preserving capability among all.This study shows that some of the existing methods may contain limitation that not applicable for specific enhancement purpose, such as the oversatruration or undersaturation problem of histogram equalisation in image enhancement, which can be revised and improved to increase the accuracy of adjustment.\nRecently, researchers are also proposing methods to increase the efficiency in satellite image pre-processing by using machine learning techniques. Acknowledged the extensive computation and deficiency in real time application, Sun et al. (2021) proposed using time-dependent deep neural network for automatic atmospheric correction and target detection. The study is based on the advantage of remote sensing (frequent, reliable and large area data) and aimed at producing a network that study all atmospheric characteristics that affect the observed total radiance. Thus, other than total radiance map, the network also requires inputs about collection day of the year and time of the day, which considers the seasonal and diurnal variability of atmosphere and their impact on incoming solar radiation and atmospheric conditions (Sun et al. 2021). Although the application of this network is limited due to the intensive time and cost in collecting ground truth measurements, the research presented how image processing in remote sensing can be improved with state-of-art technologies by showing its potential in integrating with deep learning based approach in atmospheric correction tasks.\n\n\n\nProposed deep learning solution for atmospheric correction\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Geometric Processing\nWith reference to previous studies on the influence of geometric correction on the accuracy of atmospheric correction algorithm at dark pixels and water-leaving radiance, Li and Xia (2021) analysed the influence for three surface waterbodies of different water quality class through calculating errors with ground object spectrometer measurement and analyse water reflectance by geometric correction.The result revealed that geometric correction exerts a certain degree of influence on reflectance value of atmospheric corrected image, but has small influence on overall trend. This study demonstrated how operation of geometric processing can has possible influence on the accuracy of result data and should be performed carefully when establishing GCPs. Apart from adopting automatic GCP selection, user should ensure the RMSE is minimised and under the threshold to ensure the overall accuracy. However, as the research design only involved a small sample size and collection of in-situ data may contain systematic error, conclusion retrieved from this study may need further study and verification."

    "text": "3.3 Reflection\nThis week generally covers the methods and operations in pre-processing of remote sensing imagery data. Image enhancement is one of the interesting parts in this week content as there is many flexibility in selecting the enhancement approach. With many methods developed in image enhancement, methods can be selected based on the project scale, objective and requirement of following analysis, and apply cooperatively with other enhancement operations. For example, for study that investigate topographic features, high pass filter can be applied with contrast enhancement to optimise the visualisation in local pixels. In addition, PCA is an effective technique that can be explore more on, especially for project with large dataset that has more redundancy in multi-spectral imageries. For future studies, automation in correction is possible aspect to develop, such as the automatic atmospheric correction proposed by Sun et al. (2021). Although “analysis ready data” is available that benefit studies like time-series analysis and reduce cost for image pre-processing in general, future study on automatic correction is still vital for platform that doesn’t provide ARD.\n\n\n\n\n“Filtering and Neighbourhood Processing.” 2016.

According to Kanai (2014), the policy comprises a three-legged entrepreneurial strategy to reconcile the Manaus Free Trade Zone and construct the Amazonian Capital as a global city-region. On the other hand, with rising concern of the conservation of Amazon rainforest, Amazonas also developed ecological entrepreneurialism and passed state legislation on climate change, such as promoting high-profile conservation programmes. An examples is the Amazon Region Protected Areas (ARPA) program established in 2002 for conservation of tropical forests and preservation of biodiversity (Foster 2022).\nAmong all infrastructure, the Manaus–Iranduba Bridge is an significant development landmark that influence the territoral expansion pattern, where economic activities are located at the hyper-modern area in central Manaus and separate the south bank from economic development(Kanai 2014).\n\n\n\nManaus–Iranduba Bridge surrounded by central Manaus and ISZ\n\n\nReferencing to the previous Amazonas programmes like Manaus’ Igarapé Social and Environmental Restoration Programme (PROSAMIM), Kanai (2014) indicated that sanitising environmentally sensitive areas and focusing development in central area had lead to several shortcomings:\n1.

    "text": "4.2 Application\nRemote sensing can be apply in this context for monitoring environmental impact of the urban growth and assist policy making regarding the conservation of Amazon tropical forests. Three approaches are proposed below that apply remote sensing imagery in estimating flood risk, sediment concentration and water pollution:\n1. Flood Risk Mapping\nStudy by Farhadi and Najafzadeh (2021) applied remote sensing data with random forest technique to obtain the flood risk indices for the Galikesh River basin, Northern Iran. Landsat 8 satellite imagery and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are used to generate indices respectively in Google Earth Engine, then normalised indices are used as input in random forest to compute the importance degree of each index and is used to produce a flood hazard map. Landsat 8 satellite images are used to generate four indices: NDVI, NDWI, ST, and LU, while SRTM DEM model is used to produce six indices: Sl, SA, El, RD, WRD, and TWI. This study concern a wide range of possible factors that can lead to flood that calculating 11 indices and estimate their contribution to the flood risk, such as elevation, slope, river distance and soil texture. Data from passive and active sensors are utilised efficiently to obtain environment information from their spectral significance.\n\n\n\nResearch design for flood risk mapping\n\n\n\nSuspended-Sediment Concentration (SSC)\nIn this study, (Pereira et al. 2018) proposed a method to measure suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) and turbidity along the Middle Mississippi River (MMR) and lower Missouri River (MOR), which can be applied for sediment-related problems include both sediment deficits and surpluses. Satellite imagery is a great resources for studying SSC as it can record the sediment-water reflectance from the reflection from sediment-water mixtures in fluvial networks. From Landsat imagery, image filtering to remove the impact of cirrus clouds and cloud shadows, then average surface reflectance and standard deviation for each image are calculated. Result is validated by the available turbidity and SSC data from USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) database through stepwise regression technique. Findings in this study demonstrate the possibility of using sediment-water reflectance for monitoring sedimentation in water. SSC provide a clear interpretation as the spectral signal of SSC-water mixture will have different spectral interaction under different water condition.\nWater Pollution Assessment\nRemote sensing satellite imagery can also use to derive spatial and temporal trajectories of land cover/land use change (LCLUC) and combine with hydrological modeling to identify areas prone to high risk of soil erosion and water quality deterioration (Jordan, Ghulam, and Hartling 2014). This study first perform land-cover classification on corrected imagery with unsupervised clustering classification method, then calculate the NDVI with respect to different time interval and yearly trend. After evaluating the temporal changes of NDVI, parameters are applied to physically based distributed watershed model to simulate the impacts of land use and land management practices on water, sediments and chemical yields in surface water. By integrating the land use changes with NDVI analysis and SWAR hydrological modeling, this method can reveal how total suspended sediment is related to precipitation and land use change. Another interesting finding from the analysis is that NDVI is shown to be a potential indicator to predict the spatial distribution of total suspended sediment loading rate."

In addition, apart from showing the general picture on the real-world situation, the resulted application may also reveal local patterns, like using the flood risk mapping to identify section of river that has the severe impact from urban development. A possible difficulty in implementing remote sensing imagery in analysing environmental issues is the research may require external data for extra information and validation. The mentioned approaches also adopted data from field measurements to support the analysis process and increase the comprehensiveness of study, which the database may not be available in every country.

Instead of downloading images from external websites and process it in software, GEE allows import of image collections with dates and region filter, pre-processing and analysis on the same platform collectively. In addition, GEE provides a variety of geometries and features for geometry operations, such as allowing image clipping with shapefile. In application, many functions are also available to manage data for analysis, including image reduction, texture measurement and principal components transform. A question that I have regarding image reduction is will the compress of data generalise information and causing the loss of information.\nGEE as a cloud computing geospatial tool benefits the community by its high accessibility of data and user-friendly interface for interactive data and algorithm development. The open source use caters the general public by reducing the necessity of using computer with large processing powers and software in remote sensing analysis, which increase the equality of undertaking geospatial research in different nations (Mutanga and Kumar 2019). In overall, Zhao et al.

    "text": "5.2 Application\nResearch by Mutanga and Kumar (2019) summarised the contribution of GEE in four main themes: vegetation mapping and monitoring, landcover mapping, agricultural applications and disaster management and earth sciences. Based on the referenced articles, authors summarised that GEE is able to process huge data sets for applications in various spatial and temporal scales, while allowing the implement of automated programs at an operational level. This section will discuss the application of GEE in other themes:\n\nArchaeology Study\nLasaponara, Abate, and Masini (2022) applied GEE to support the visual interpretation of archaeological features by Sentinel satellite imagery for the lost section on the ancient Via Appia. The major difficulty in features recognition is the archaeological proxy indicators are subtle and easily attenuate due to factors like presence of microreliefs, moisture patterns and atmospheric contamination. As the features only evident in specific surface condition, authors proposed the use of multitemporal data processing with image enhancement and data reduction to capture the spatial and temporal changes of the scale and distribution of indicators (Lasaponara, Abate, and Masini 2022). The method addressed the issue in identifying the deviation on Via Appia due to the existing modern road system, showing the potential of using GEE to process earth observation imagery in archaeology. In this study, GEE was able to calculate spectral signature over a large time span without requiring a high-levle hardware, which is also applicable for studying cultural properties with different characteristics and geographical location. Yet, the lack of high resolution image collections in GEE may limit the degree of visual interpretation in archaeology study and may not be the most effective approach for indicators with low visibility.\nSettlement Mapping\nThe recent study by Matarira, Mutanga, and Naidu (2022) implemented the cloud-based computing techniques in GEE to interpret the morphologically varied informal settlements by spectral and textural information in Durban, Sourth Africa. The paper used spectral bands, spectral indices and texture features from Sentinel 2A imagery as the input of random forest classification, in which textural features is calculated by the GLCM algorithm in ENVI software.\n\n\n\n\nResearch workflow for studying settlements in Durban\n\n\nReviewing the successful application for informal settlement mapping in GEE, Matarira, Mutanga, and Naidu (2022) pointed out that the characteristics of simplified access and process of satellite data, versatility and adaptability of platform, and efficiency in performing pixel-based classification improves urban area mapping from traditional static, product-based approach. This study demonstrates the ability of GEE in handling large dataset and performing more advance analysis like random forest classification. It shows how the bulk of processing and analysis of remote sensing imagery can be performed collectively in GEE to increase the efficiency in script writing. For the GLCM textural features, a possible improvement for the research workflow is using the ee.Image.glcmTexture function in GEE instead of estimating GLCM texture features with ENVI, which simplify the procedures by minimising the transition between platforms."

    "text": "6.1 Summary\nThis week lecture and practical discussed the image classification techniques in remote sensing and how it can be applied in different environmental studies. Content focuses on the utilisation of machine learning in categotising areas based on spectral reflectance or texture. The figure below summarised the approach discussed in lecture:\n\n\n\nFlow chart of machine learning in image classification\n\n\nWhen performing classification with machine learning, several considerations should be account. These considerations helps in defining parameters for model training and ensure the accuracy of outcome.\nOn the other hand, 2 types of classification is introduced:unsupervised classification and supervised classification. This week lecture introduced several methods in each classification type:\n\n\n\nTypes of classification introduced this week\n\n\nRecent research focuses on the use of machine learning/ expert systems or hybrid approach in image classification. Mehmood et al. (2022) provided a more detailed summary of the basic divisions in learning techniques, especially for deep learning models.\n\n\n\nImage classification techniques\n\n\nApart from considering the type of techniques to apply, user also needs to decide between pixel-based, object-based and scene-based classification methods. Mehmood et al. (2022) point out that as the spatial resolution of remote sensing images has drastically increased, the popularity of using pixel-based has reduced and research trends changes towards applying object-based classification.\nIn practical, supervised classifier (CART and random forest) are attempted in three different scenarios, where: 1. Training CART classifier without specifying % of training data 2. Training random forest classifier with specifying % of training data 3. Training random forest classifier with specifying % of training data and greater amount of polygons The questions I have for this practice is regarding the pre-processing of EO data and presentation of output. To improve the filtering result of cloud mask, I tried the median approach for taking only the middle value of each pixel. Although this approach can remove clouds due to its high reflectiveness, information in pixels will be generalised and causing lost of a lot of data. Alternatively, more advanced cloud detection or filtering cloud percentage in data source may be more effective to ensure the exclusion of clouds while retaining most information.\nFor my analysis of Hong Kong, I also experienced that the clipped image from FAO GAUL global admin layers may not completely display part of the area. Problem occurs at Chek Lap Kok International Airport where a portion was clipped away. An alternative is to use boundary shapefile from official data source or carefully select an appropriate dataset from catalog.\n\n\n\nFail to completely clip the whole extent"

    "text": "6.2 Application\nBased on this week’s content, I would like to study the application of CART classifier and random forest classifier, then focus on the research trend in applying object-based classification.\n\n6.2.1 CART Classification\nTo classify the land cover of Xinjiang effectively, Li et al. (2023) adopted CART from decision tree algorithm due to its ability in analysing the relationship between multiple attributes for generating prediction model. Authors extracted 4 kind of features (spectral features, vegetation indices, water index & radar backscattering coefficient) from pre-processed high resolution images, then engaged gini coefficient, maximum tree depth, and pruning in the model development. A focus in this piece of research is the identification of high spectral reflectance features, like buildings with metal and cement rooftops. Authors approached this concern by using SAR images for detecting buildings/ residential regions and optical image for classifying different types of rooftop along with NDMRI index.\nThis research presents the importance of comprehensive considerations during project design, which characteristics of features should take into account and apply appropriate input data accordingly. Accuracy of machine learning model is greatly determined by the quality of data input. Thus, supporting the research with observations other than multi-spectral image should also be considered.\n\n\n6.2.2 Random Forest Classification\nWith the need of compiling geological map series in Tunisia, Albert and Ammar (2021) proposed the use of random forest classification to automate mapping process with open source satellite imagery. The input data of model was collected at the Jebel Meloussi area by integrating remotely sensed data with topographic elevation data to derive spectral indices (NDVI &d geological indices) and morphometric variables (topographic wetness index & topographic ruggedness index). Authors also applied a variety of techniques to optimise model parameters, such as estimating probability of estimation by out of bag method and evaluating the cross-correlation of the variables.\nApplication of machine learning and remotely sensed data in geological mapping has more concerns than LULC mapping, as cartographic materials should be included to describe geological features characteristic morphology. Authors demonstrated a lot of effort in deriving the right choice of predictors and parameters by considering: - highlight of iron-bearing minerals in lithological variables - stronger predictor variables from available data in mean decrease gini values - effectiveness of predictor variables in characterising different geological categories - estimation probability from different sample method - user and producer accuracy test This study provide a good example on how to structure image classification by the detailed description on concerns and way of approach for variable selection, while accuracy assessment was performed to ensure model’s accuracy.\n\n\n6.2.3 Object-based Classification\nStudy by Guo et al. (2021) used object-based classification with Landsat time series data to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of glacier and snow fluctuations at Namcha Barwa–Gyala Peri (NBGP) massif, where most serious glacier retreat is experienced under climate change. The research used object-based classification because of its ability in discriminating objects with similar spectral features and adaptive processing units that applicable for multisource data. Similar to the observation mentioned by Mehmood et al. (2022), Guo et al. (2021) indicated that pixel-based classification restricts the use of classification features and result in ‘salt and pepper’ effects. Using Landsat and topographic data, debris-glacier is classified with the following procedures:\n\n\n\nProcedures of debris-glacier classification\n\n\nA critical challenge of this study is the need of defining threshold for implementing multiple hierarchical level rule-based classification. Other than using NDVI to extract non-vegetation or sparse vegetation region, analyst need to have a substantial background understanding of feature characteristics physically and spectrally, such as defining elevation threshold from glacier terminus and slope restriction of debris-covered glacier. Therefore, the glacial environment dynamics is comparatively complex and challenging to classify, especially when segments in object-based classification is generated from the criteria of homogeneity."

Relatively abundant justification regarding method selection is provided in Guo et al. (2021)’s study, which object-based classification stands out from pixel-based method due to its consideration of homogeneity. This is also an interesting point that discussed at the last part of week 6 lecture. User should clearly identify the need and purpose of applying image classification, the suitability of applying image classification with EO data for the research area, and type of classification to be used (conventional/ fuzzy & pixel-based/ object-based).

Recent study by Saba et al. (2023) compared pixel, sub-pixel and object-based image analysis techniques for landslides detection in Lesser Himalaya. Authors applied pixel-based maximum likelihood classifier, sub-pixel analysis with sine cardinal and object-based analysis with image segmentation on high resolution satellite images obtained by different sensor, while accuracy was examined by binary confusion matrix, kappa coefficient and F-score. Result from this study presented that object-based image classification retrieved the best result with highest accuracy in landslide detection, followed by sub-pixel analysis, and lastly pixel-based approach.\nIn terms of study design, authors demonstrated how accuracy evaluation can be implemented in practice. The study explains how to structure a comprehensive research by considering the advantages and limitations of assessment indices. For example, to achieve a balanced evaluation and consider, authors also used F-score to evaluate the effectiveness of classification. In addition, this study emphasised on the strength and limitation of each classification method based on the result and literature review:\nPixel Based\nLimitation:\n\ndependent on spectral signature\nlower detection accuracy due to spectral overlaying effects\nfalse identification of speckled noisy result as clusters\nnot desirable for low and medium resolution data due to size of landslide\n\nSub-pixel Based\nStrength:\n\neffective detection from spectral information and masks\n\nLimitation:\n\ndependent on spectral signature\nfalse identification of speckled noisy result as clusters\nsub-pixel information is hard to retain in resampling, ortho-rectifiation and co-registration\n\nObject Based\nStrength:\n\nrobust in detecting landslide\n\nLimitation:\n\ndependent on type, spatial resolution and temporal resolution\nnot desirable for low and medium resolution data\n\nFindings from this study derive same observation with Mehmood et al. (2022), which object based image analysis has better performance than the other 2 types of classification on high resolution image. On the other hand, the summary above shows that although sub-pixel and object based analysis provides a better overall result and accuracy, they do have additional issues to consider during implementation. Using sub-pixel based and object based analysis requires more attention on the preservation of information or feature details, and have more difficulty in ensuring the reproducibility due to the diverse settings and parameter selection."

    "section": "8.1 Summary",
    "text": "8.1 Summary\nThis week focused on urban heat island (UHI) effect to study how it is targeted in global policies and local policies. Urban heat island effect is a phenomenon where urban area retain more heat than sub-urban/ rural area due to urban design and density, causing a higher atmospheric and surface temperature in urban areas. The key factors of urban heat island effect are urbanisation, increasing manufactured materials and increasing heating and cooling energy needs, which the relationship is shown in the figure below (Mohajerani, Bakaric, and Jeffrey-Bailey 2017).\n\n\n\nRelationship between UHI and key factors (Mohajerani, Bakaric, and Jeffrey-Bailey 2017)\n\n\nIn the view of the social, environmental and economic impact of UHI, global and local policies are proposed and implemented to ease the UHI effect, while promoting sustainability in urban planning and design. The following table concluded the examples of policies explained in class:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe examples above demonstrate a common problem that no specific methodology and way of implementation are given. Rethinking on how an effective planning can be proposed, some considerations for policy making on UHI effect are discussed with case studies:\n1. Selected Methodology and Data\nEnvironmental issue should be investigated with a correct approach and dataset. An example is the evaluation of implementing landscape cooling methods (e.g. surface coating, cool roads) by analysing air and surface temperature, which study revealed that there is no significant relationship and effectiveness in between. Evaluation should be done with the right matrices and provide justification on the selected approach.\n2. Disparities in City\nPolicies should consider how neighbourhoods are designed as not all areas in have equal access to cooler spaces. These disparities are related to the previous planning, development and maintenance of communities, especially for places that have housing segregation, causing an unequal scene in accessing cooler space, like the green space. Example shown in class is the formerly redlined areas in Portland.\n3. Application of Data\nAlthough applying EO data to inform the cooling strategy, the Fremantle’s Urban Forest Plan failed to comprehensively identify location that requires cooling. The data analysis they did was relied on single temperature image with aggregation, which ignored the data trend and reduce the reproducibility of strategy. In this case, the analysis did not provide sufficient data and handle the data correctly, causing a misleading result and interpretation.\n4. Effectiveness of Planning Requirements\nDespite detailed statistical requirements in greening strategy are provided, the policy in Perth Metropolitan Area and Singapore failed to specifically define the arrangement conditions, such as providing definition of open space and indicating the requirement on placement. Thus, when designing an approach in policy/ plan, one should consider how resources are eqaully and equitably distributed to ensure the strategy is sustainable."

    "text": "8.2 Application\nMany studies proposed various methodology to integrate urban planning policies for mitigating UHI effect. This section will present some assessment method that monitor UHI in local-level policies, and analyse the effectiveness comparing to case studies in lecture.\n\n8.2.1 Urban Heat Island’s Vulnerability Assessment\nA methodology for assessing UHI vulnerability is proposed by Técher, Ait Haddou, and Aguejdad (2023) to identify prone area with high vulnerability . A total of 15 input indicators are developed from vulnerability studies and generate urban vulnerability map based on 3 components: 1. Urban planning policies: green spaces, building footprint, building height, construction’s location & air conditioning 2. Exposure to urban overheating: topography, proximity to natural areas, SUHI intensity, population density & land uses (daytime & nightime) 3. Sensitivity to urban overheating: sensitive population, heath and care facilities, low-income households & building age These indicators are weighted by explicit weights in calculation and the dimensionality of combined output is reduced by principal component analysis.\nAuthors adopted the UHI vulnerability assessment scheme in the Mediterranean city of Montpellier context to reveal that the most vulnerable zones are distributed close to urban centers and analysis the composition of landuse, footprint, planted space and air conditioning in these zone.\n\n\n\nFramework of assessment scheme\n\n\nThe proposed framework is comprehensively built by considering various input data to analysis the UHI effect. This study shows a lot of effort in literature review for the design of framework, especially where indicators of each component are clearly defined with parameter settings and justification on effects of UHI vulnerability based on relevant literature. The source of data, processing and matrices are also transparently presented, leading to a high reproducibility in future implementation and improvement. Comparing to examples in class, this assessment scheme provides a clear planning requirement (e.g. clear definition of urban vulnerability levels), approach that has justified relationship with UHI and framework with diverse considerations (e.g. socio-economic, topological, demographic aspects). Based on this assessment, policy makers can identify spatial pattern in generic scale, and specifically analysis according to different indicators.\n\n\n8.2.2 Urban Life Cycle Assessment\nSusca and Pomponi (2020) suggested a pathway to expand the current life cycle assessment (LCA) framework from only capturing the complexity and impact of urban settlement, to including interactions between built environment and local climate, which enables effective policy making for UHI effects. Referencing LCA studies that focused on UHI mitigation, authors proposed that UHI can be included in methodology by either simulating the interactions between built environment and local climate by physics-based model, or statistically and spatially aggregate relevant mathematical model, which characterisation factors for smog, water quality resources and human health can be inputted to the LCA methodology.\nSimilar to the research above, this study also justify the approach design and factor selection by reviewing published literature. Authors suggested potential indicators that can be integrated to LCA for evaluating UHI-mitigation measures. Applying this expanded urban LCA in policy making may able to justify the selected methodology/ factors by literature. However, the expanded framework has shortcomings in the diversity of factors that it considered and the statistics/ mathematical calculation it provided is based on specific region/ case study, causing a limit direct application of proposed methodology, as urban settlements is different city are unique in structure. Therefore, reviewing the consideration of policy making mentioned this week, this assessment framework may have deficency in showing the disparities in cities."

The lecture content guide us through the evaluation of policy’s effectiveness by showing how policy can have shortcomings in its framework and design. The redlining example in America in particular brings up a lot of consideration in policy making, which emphasis how the history and background of urban planning can highly impact the equality between neighbourhoods, such as the inequality of accessing green space which the quantity and quality of urban green space may varies between places.\nAn important idea I retried from this week content is literature review acts as an important role when structuring framework for policy. Other than providing insight on how the current system is formed based on historical record, it also assist the justification of definitions, methodology by previous literature and risk evaluation on approach. Therefore, in future applications, I have a better idea on how I should approach an issue/ project that involve policies, and how I can evaluate a policy critically.\n\n\n\n\nMohajerani, Abbas, Jason Bakaric, and Tristan Jeffrey-Bailey. 2017. “The Urban Heat Island Effect, Its Causes, and Mitigation, with Reference to the Thermal Properties of Asphalt Concrete.” Journal of Environmental Management 197: 522–38. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.03.095.\n\n\nSusca, Tiziana, and Francesco Pomponi. 2020. “Heat Island Effects in Urban Life Cycle Assessment: Novel Insights to Include the Effects of the Urban Heat Island and UHI‐mitigation Measures in LCA for Effective Policy Making.” Journal of Industrial Ecology 24 (2): 410–23. https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.12980.\n\n\nTécher, Magalie, Hassan Ait Haddou, and Rahim Aguejdad. 2023. “Urban Heat Island’s Vulnerability Assessment by Integrating Urban Planning Policies: A Case Study of Montpellier Méditerranée Metropolitan Area, France.” Sustainability 15 (3): 1820. https://doi.org/10.3390/su15031820."
