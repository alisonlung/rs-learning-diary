Hello :) My name is Yuet Yung Lung, an international student from Hong Kong studying MSc Urban Spatial Science at UCL. I graduated from BSc Geomatics (Land Surveying), Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I formerly worked as a land survey graduate and GIS technician in HK and UK.

Welcome to my Learning Diary! I am excited to learn more about remote sensing :D ![GIF By Rick And Morty](https://media1.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZGNlNDU5ZTBjYmE1ODU5NzQzNGIxODEwOTdkNjAyM2RiMTJkZjMzMyZjdD1n/DTh1K6VuivY0gEuzWy/giphy.gif){fig-align="center" width="714"}
