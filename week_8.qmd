# Temperature and Policy

## Summary

This week focused on urban heat island (UHI) effect to study how it is
targeted in global policies and local policies. Urban heat island effect
is a phenomenon where urban area retain more heat than sub-urban/ rural
area due to urban design and density, causing a higher atmospheric and
surface temperature in urban areas. The key factors of urban heat island
effect are urbanisation, increasing manufactured materials and
increasing heating and cooling energy needs, which the relationship is
shown in the figure below [@MohajeraniAbbas2017Tuhi].

In the view of the social, environmental and economic impact of UHI,
global and local policies are proposed and implemented to ease the UHI
effect, while promoting sustainability in urban planning and design. The
following table concluded the examples of policies explained in class:

The examples above demonstrate a common problem that no specific
methodology and way of implementation are given. Rethinking on how an
effective planning can be proposed, some considerations for policy
making on UHI effect are discussed with case studies:

*1. Selected Methodology and Data*

Environmental issue should be investigated with a correct approach and
dataset. An example is the evaluation of implementing landscape cooling
methods (e.g. surface coating, cool roads) by analysing air and surface
temperature, which study revealed that there is no significant
relationship and effectiveness in between. Evaluation should be done
with the right matrices and provide justification on the selected
approach.

*2. Disparities in City*

Policies should consider how neighbourhoods are designed as not all
areas in have equal access to cooler spaces. These disparities are
related to the previous planning, development and maintenance of
communities, especially for places that have housing segregation,
causing an unequal scene in accessing cooler space, like the green
space. Example shown in class is the formerly redlined areas in
Portland.

*3. Application of Data*

Although applying EO data to inform the cooling strategy, the
Fremantle's Urban Forest Plan failed to comprehensively identify
location that requires cooling. The data analysis they did was relied on
single temperature image with aggregation, which ignored the data trend
and reduce the reproducibility of strategy. In this case, the analysis
did not provide sufficient data and handle the data correctly, causing a
misleading result and interpretation.

*4. Effectiveness of Planning Requirements*

Despite detailed statistical requirements in greening strategy are
provided, the policy in Perth Metropolitan Area and Singapore failed to
specifically define the arrangement conditions, such as providing
definition of open space and indicating the requirement on placement.
Thus, when designing an approach in policy/ plan, one should consider
how resources are eqaully and equitably distributed to ensure the
strategy is sustainable.

## Application

Many studies proposed various methodology to integrate urban planning
policies for mitigating UHI effect. This section will present some
assessment method that monitor UHI in local-level policies, and analyse
the effectiveness comparing to case studies in lecture.

### Urban Heat Island's Vulnerability Assessment

A methodology for assessing UHI vulnerability is proposed by
@TécherMagalie2023UHIV to identify prone area with high vulnerability .
A total of 15 input indicators are developed from vulnerability studies
and generate urban vulnerability map based on 3 components:

1\. *Urban planning policies*: green spaces, building footprint,
building height, construction's location & air conditioning

2\. *Exposure to urban overheating*: topography, proximity to natural
areas, SUHI intensity, population density & land uses (daytime &
nightime)

3\. *Sensitivity to urban overheating*: sensitive population, heath and
care facilities, low-income households & building age

These indicators are weighted by explicit weights in calculation and the
dimensionality of combined output is reduced by principal component
analysis.

Authors adopted the UHI vulnerability assessment scheme in the
Mediterranean city of Montpellier context to reveal that the most
vulnerable zones are distributed close to urban centers and analysis the
composition of landuse, footprint, planted space and air conditioning in
these zone.

The proposed framework is comprehensively built by considering various
input data to analysis the UHI effect. This study shows a lot of effort
in literature review for the design of framework, especially where
indicators of each component are clearly defined with parameter settings
and justification on effects of UHI vulnerability based on relevant
literature. The source of data, processing and matrices are also
transparently presented, leading to a high reproducibility in future
implementation and improvement. Comparing to examples in class, this
assessment scheme provides a clear planning requirement (e.g. clear
definition of urban vulnerability levels), approach that has justified
relationship with UHI and framework with diverse considerations (e.g.
socio-economic, topological, demographic aspects). Based on this
assessment, policy makers can identify spatial pattern in generic scale,
and specifically analysis according to different indicators.

### Urban Life Cycle Assessment

@SuscaTiziana2020Hiei suggested a pathway to expand the current life
cycle assessment (LCA) framework from only capturing the complexity and
impact of urban settlement, to include interactions between built
environment and local climate, which enables effective policy making for
UHI effects. Referencing LCA studies that focused on UHI mitigation,
authors proposed that UHI can be included in methodology by either
simulating the interactions between built environment and local climate
by physics-based model, or statistically and spatially aggregate
relevant mathematical model, which characterisation factors for smog,
water quality resources and human health can be inputted to the LCA
methodology.

Similar to the research above, this study also justify the approach
design and factor selection by reviewing published literature. Authors
suggested potential indicators that can be integrated to LCA for
evaluating UHI-mitigation measures. Applying this expanded urban LCA in
policy making may able to justify the selected methodology/ factors by
literature. However, the expanded framework has shortcomings in the
diversity of factors that it considered and the statistics/ mathematical
calculation it provided is based on specific region/ case study, causing
a limit direct application of proposed methodology, as urban settlements
in different city are unique in structure. Therefore, reviewing the
consideration of policy making mentioned this week, this assessment
framework may have deficiency in showing the disparities in cities.

## Reflection

This week's content is interesting for me as case studies from different
countries are discussed through analysing the objective, background and
methodology of local UHI mitigating policies. The lecture content guide
us through the evaluation of policy's effectiveness by showing how
policy can have shortcomings in its framework and design. The redlining
example in America in particular brings up a lot of consideration in
policy making, which emphasis how the history and background of urban
planning can highly impact the equality between neighbourhoods, such as
the inequality of accessing green space which the quantity and quality
of urban green space may varies between places.

An important idea I retrieved from this week content is literature
review acts as an important role when structuring framework for policy.
Other than providing insight on how the current system is formed based
on historical record, it also assist the justification of definitions,
methodology by previous literature and risk evaluation on approach.
Therefore, in future applications, I have a better idea on how I should
approach an issue/ project that involve policies, and how I can evaluate
a policy critically.
